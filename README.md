Brace interview code project

On startup describes the type of a data a user will receive, along with a button, which when clicked calls to the api, and displays the data on screen, replacing the description text with a table or list type view.

2. Allow a user to request more items somehow. This should add to the current list, rather than replacing it (this might be with another click somewhere, a next button, an infinite scroller, etc)
3. Add an input somewhere that, as a user types into it, filters the currently showing results (no need to fetch things based on this, just filter the current list as is).
4. When clicking on an item in this list or table view, navigate to an item specific view that shows a bit more detail. If we go to this route directly (instead of navigating with links) we should still see the content here

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
